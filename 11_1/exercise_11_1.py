# Exercises from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
# These exercises are about Testings using the pytest package.

# 1a. Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name.
# 1a.1. The function should return a single string of the form City, Country, such as Santiago, Chile.
# 1b. Store the function in a module called city_functions.py,
# 1b.1. and save this file in a new folder so pytest won’t try to run the tests we’ve already written.
# 1c. Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote.
# 1c.1. Write a function called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string.
# 1d. Run the test, and make sure test_city_country() passes.
